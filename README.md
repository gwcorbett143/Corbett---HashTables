Challenge One (put your answer in your README)

Which is a better hash function:

x % n where n is a large prime number
Prove your answer with a simple example.

Challenge Two (put your answer in your README)

Is char values summed % 599 a good hash function for strings? Why or why not?

Challenge Three (put your answer in your README)

Take a look at Java's HashMap class and how it produces hashed values, then describe how it works. (You may have to look at other classes to find the actual mathematical function! Follow the trail of breadcrumbs...)
